# Password Cracker Simulation

A simple Python-based password cracking simulation tool that demonstrates both dictionary attack and brute-force attack methods.  
This project is for ethical hacking education, password strength awareness, and cybersecurity learning.

## Features

- Checks password strength (length, uppercase, digit, special character)
- Simulates dictionary attack using a list of most common passwords
- Simulates limited brute-force attack (for demo/education)
- Counts attempts and time taken to “crack” a password
- Gives password security tips and user-friendly output

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Clone this repository or download the password cracking script.
3. Open the terminal and run:
4. Enter any password to test its security.
5. See if your password is easily cracked and get instant feedback.

## Example Output
Enter a password to test: yashika@123

Password Strength Score (out of 4): 3
Your password has good complexity.

Starting dictionary attack...
Not found in dictionary, moving to brute force...
Password cracked by brute force after 21548 attempts in 2.18 seconds.


## Educational Purpose Only

This project is for learning and off-network ethical hacking demonstrations only.  
**Never use password cracking tools without proper legal and ethical permission.**
